   <p><span class="bio">
     My name is Anas Ahmed. I am a 3rd year computer science major. I was originally a computer engineering major, but I decided I preferred programming more. I came to America when I was about a year old with my parents from England. I have always liked computers from an early age and have worked various jobs in the IT industry helping users who are not as tech-savy. When I was younger I had an old Dell desktop which was my first gateway to the world of computing. Although I did not program much, I learned how to efficently troubleshoot Windows problems as I found it fun to fix computer problems. I hope to apply the skills I've fostered to computer science to hopefully become a back-end developer.
